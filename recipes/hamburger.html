        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of a cooked 
                meat patty on a bun or roll. You can order a 
                hamburger, fries, and a shake at most fast food 
                restaurants. Hamburgers are traditionally made 
                with ground beef and served with onions, tomatoes, 
                lettuce, ketchup, and other garnishes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>

                <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
